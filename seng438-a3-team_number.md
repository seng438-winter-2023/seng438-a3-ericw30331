# 1 Introduction

The purpose of this assignment was to perform more unit testing using Junit in eclipse. In the last assignment we were tasked with created black box unit tests using Junit, and in this assignment we will create more unit tests through white box testing. We will be developing tests using the white box technique and attempting to increase the coverage of 2 classes within JFreeChart, these are Datautilities and Range. We will be using Eclipse's built in coverage tool to check the adequecy of the written unit tests. There are 3 types of coverage that we will be focusing on in this assignment, these are Statement, Branch and Method Coverage.

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

Our testing strategy for this assignment would make use of the coverage tool provided within eclipse (eclemma) and the white box testing technique to develop our new unit tests. Firstly, we decided to create test methods for every method within Range and Datautilities. After this first round of testing production we checked the coverage of the unit tests and created more tests based on missing branches and statements. Each iteration was made and checked for increased coverage until an adequate amount of coverage was achieved. In our case there were specific branches that we were unable to reach (infeasible path).

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

# 5 A detailed report of the coverage achieved of each class and method (a screen shot from the code cover results in green and red color would suffice)
